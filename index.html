    <section> <h3> My Favorite Animal is a Whale. I love Any kind of Whale! I have started liking whales ever since I was 5. I am 11 now, so I've been liking whales for about 6 years! Liking whales has inspired me to become a Marine Biologist when I'm older and help the whales since they're endangered.My Favorite type of whale would specifically be an Orca (Killer Whale). I fell in Love with Orcas by watching a movie at the age of 5 called "Free Willy". So when I got my first stuffed Whale, I named it "Willy", after the Whale's name in the movie. I will always love Whales and they will always be my favorite animal!
